To start the frontend make sure you install yarn. Navigate to the app folder in src, and 
`yarn start`. If it errors, you may have to run `yarn install`


This may overwrite the stylesheet but aside from that, should work fine.


Backend is started as per usual through the IDE.

This application simulates a basic online food ordering UX utilizing bootstrap with multiple restaurants.


This is built upon the Spring/React/JPA stack

Backend fully handles Entity and database connections, while frontend proxies for UI and functions for data input and modification

Have a great summer. Sorry for underwhelming features. Lots of family and time troubles.

I still plan to finalize this project with a cart, users, and complex orders but for the time being, this is what I have. But this project really sparked my interest in full stack and especially front end development

Thanks for being the most influential professor I've had, and probably have yet to ever have. These past 2 years have certainly changed me as a programmer, and for the better!

Warmest regards,
