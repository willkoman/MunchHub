To start the frontend make sure you install yarn. Navigate to the app folder in src, and yarn start. If it errors, you may have to run yarn install
This may overwrite the stylesheet but aside from that, should work fine.

Backend is started as per usual.

Have a great summer. Sorry for underwhelming features. Lots of family and time troubles.

Thanks for being the most influential professor I've had, and probably have yet to ever have. These past 2 years have certainly changed me as a programmer, and for the better!

Warmest regards,
